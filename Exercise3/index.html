  <p>Goofy is a cartoon character created by The Walt Disney Company. Goofy is a tall, anthropomorphic animal who typically wears a turtle neck and vest, with pants, shoes, white gloves,
    and a tall hat originally designed as a rumpled fedora. Goofy is a close friend of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck.
    He is normally characterized as hopelessly clumsy and dim-witted, yet this interpretation is not always definitive;
    occasionally Goofy is shown as intuitive and clever, albeit in his own unique, eccentric way. </p>
